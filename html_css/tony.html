    <h2><u>Tony Cinematic Universe: Tony Stark's journey through the MCU</u></h2>
    <p><b>Iron Man:</b> In 2008, Tony Stark leads a Stark Industries' weapon demonstration in Afghanistan where he is attacked. He is captured after a Jericho missile is fired near him causing shrapnel metal near his heart. In his cave prison, Dr. Yensen saves Tony's life by attaching an electromagnet to his chest. To escape they build the first Iron Man suit powered by a new miniature arc reactor. Once Tony flees and is rescued by his best friend Rhodey, he declares that his company no longer manufacture weapons. Stark retreats to his lab to recreate his Iron Man suit. When he discovers his weapons being sold to terrorists, he flies there with his new suit to destroy them. Tony's business partner Obadiah Stane, who sent for his death, steals his arc reactor to power Stane's own creation. Tony goes after him with his old arc reactor and the help of Pepper and defeats Obadiah. After, a press conference is held where Tony Stark reveals that he is Iron Man. At the end he meets with Nick Fury who introduces him to the Avengers Initiative.</p>
    <p><b>Iron Man 2:</b> Six months after revealing his identity and using his suit to help the world, Tony Stark's arc reactor starts poisoning him. Also, the Senate is on him to give up the Iron Man suit to the military. He appoints Pepper as CEO of Stark Industries and hires Natalie Rushman as his assistant. Tony enters a race where he is attacked by Ivan Vanko with an arc reactor creation of his own. With the help of Happy, Tony defeats him and sends him to jail. For his birthday, Tony throws a reckless party where he gets wasted and battles Rhodey with the Iron Man suit. Stark is visited by Nick Fury along with undercover spy Natasha Romanoff, and they send him away to find a cure for his heart. With the help of his dad's old stuff and his AI JARVIS, Tony creates a new element to combat the poison. At the weapons expo his competition, Justin Hammer, reveals new suits for the military created by Ivan, who he set free. Ivan uses the suits to go after Tony, and with Rhodey and Nat's help they destroy all the drones. At the end Fury meets with Tony again to go over the Avengers Initiative in which he will take part as only consultant.</p>
    <p><b>The Incredible Hulk:</b> In the post credit scene, we see Tony meet with General Ross to discuss the whereabouts of the Hulk. This we assume to be as one of his tasks as consultant for the Avengers Initiative.</p>
    <p><b>The Avengers:</b> In 2012 after Loki attacks SHIELD, Phil Coulson meets with Tony to research the Tesseract. When Loki attacks Germany, Stark flies off to help Black Widow and Captain America capture him. Thor appears taking Loki and battles Cap and Tony over him. They all go back to the ship where they meet with Bruce Banner to begin their search for the tesseract. As Tony tries to figure out SHIELD's motives, Loki's men attack them mid-argument. Stark tries to save the hellicarrier from falling while The Hulk is released. After Phil is murdered, Tony along with the other "Avengers" decide they should go after Loki themselves. A portal appears sending Chitauri into New York and the Avengers battle them out. A nuclear missile is then sent to New York by the government which Tony tries to intercept. He sends it into the portal to outer space to blow up the Chitauri fleet. As the portal closes, Stark barely falls through and the battle is over. They capture Loki, and the six hero's are now officially known as the Avengers.</p>
    <p><b>Iron Man 3:</b> After the Battle of New York, Tony suffers from anxiety attacks, and insomnia. This causes him to stay up all night creating more suits. When Happy suffers from one of the Mandarin's attacks, Tony threatens him. His house is then attacked by helicopters, and Tony goes down into the ocean. His suit saves him and sends him to Tennessee in search of the Mandarin. Iron Man is presumed dead while Tony gets help from a kid, Harley Keener, to repower his suit. While trying to figure out what happened in the bombings, he is attacked again and escapes with the help of Harley. Stark infiltrates the Mandarin's home in Miami to find the terrorist be a fake employed by Killian. Tony is captured along with Pepper who was injected with Extremis. Summoning his armor, Tony breaks out and meets with Rhodey to save the president. Air Force One is attacked by Eric Savin in the Iron Patriot suit. The president is taken, and the passengers aboard are saved by a remote controlled Iron Man suit. Stark and Rhodey go after Killian where they are again attacked by Extremis soldiers. Tony summons the rest of his many suits and tries to save Pepper who falls to her presumed death in a fire. Killian is defeated by Pepper who survived because of the Extremis. Tony blows up all his suits to show Pepper that she's the only thing he cares about. Pepper gets treated for her Extremis, and Tony gets surgery to remove the shrapnel metal out of his heart so he will no longer need the arc reactor in his chest. At the end Tony throw his arc reactor into the ocean and drives off from the remains of his Malibu home.</p>
    <p><b>Avengers: Age of Ultron:</b> By 2015 the Avengers reassemble after SHIELD has fallen. The old Stark Tower is now their headquarters, the Avengers Tower, and they go on missions to HYDRA bases. They find Loki's sceptor, and Wanda Maximoff manipulates Tony's mind. He sees a vision of the Avengers dead that causes him to take the sceptor for further research. Tony tries to create Ultron with it alongside Banner in wanting to protect the world. When Ultron awoke he created a body for it out of the Iron Legion parts and attacked the Avengers. They go after Ultron to try to stop it while Wanda releases the Hulk. Tony uses the Hulkbuster Armor to get him, and the Avengers go into hiding after the destruction. After Fury gets the Avengers back out, Tony hacks into NEXUS, and the Avengers attack Ultron stealing the vibranium body. Tony decides upload JARVIS to it; thus Vision is born. The Avengers head to Sokovia with Tony's new AI FRIDAY. After fighting of Ultron's robot army and evacuating the city, Tony and Thor blow up Sokovia to stop it from crashing down to Earth. A New Avengers Facility is built in Upstate New York, and Tony leaves to spend time with Pepper.</p>
    <p><b>Captain America: Civil War:</b> Because of Tony's involvement being Iron Man, his relationship with Pepper ends. He gives a speech at MIT where he shows his new tech BARF and funds all the students' projects. The mother of a Sokovia victim attacks him and feeds Tony's guilt. The Sokovia Accords are introduced and Tony agrees to sign seeing how much damadge the Avengers have caused. After the bombing of the UN meeting, Steve Rogers looks for Bucky Barnes and gets arrested for going against the Accords. Stark confronts him and tries to get him to sign but he resists. Barnes escapes capture and Tony fights him. Stark is sent to capture Rogers and Barnes and forms a team to go after them. Black Widow, Black Panther, War Machine, Spider-Man, and Vision are on Stark's side. They go against Cap's team of Wanda, Falcon, Bucky, Hawkeye, Ant-man, and battle in an airport. Natasha lets Steve escape, and Rhodey is shot by Vision crashing to the ground. After going through evidence showing Bucky was being framed by Zemo, Tony flies off to where Cap's team was imprisoned. With much hesitation, Sam tells him where Steve went and goes to Siberia. Tony makes amends with Cap, and along with Bucky investigate the Hydra base where the Winter Soldiers have been killed. Zemo reveals his plan of getting them there to show Tony a video of Barnes murdering his parents. Stark attacks Barnes and Rogers admits he knew all along. Tony feeling betrayed goes after Bucky while Steve tries to stop him. The 3 intensely battle it out. Tony blasts off Barnes' metal arm off while Steve slams his shield into Tony's arc reactor. Tony, powerless and furious, tells Steve to leave the shield behind because he didn't deserve it. He is then left all alone. Back at the Avengers facility Tony helps out Rhodey with new tech for his legs and receives a letter from Steve Rogers. He reads Steve saying he's sorry about not telling him about his parents and gives him a phone to call him whenever he needed help. At the end Ross calls him asking for help but Tony puts him on hold giving Cap time to escape with the rest of the imprisoned Avengers.</p>
    <p><b>Spider-man: Homecoming:</b> After the events of Civil War, Tony returns Peter home. He tells him to keep the suit and stay out of trouble until someone calls him for the next mission.

When Peter almost drowned after fighting the Vulture, Tony sends one of his suits to save him remotely controlling it from Dubai. He tells Peter to let him handle the Vulture which he ignores. Tony contacts the FBI about the Vulture enhanced weapons and calls Peter to compliment him on his work in DC. Peter hangs up on Tony to capture the Volture on the Staten Island Ferry. Tony being suspicious, flies off in his suit to see the Ferry splitting in half. Tony uses Stark tech to fix the ferry and meets with Peter. He chastisises Peter for disobeying him and takes away the suit. Moving day arrives after Tony sold Avengers Tower and Peter stops the Vulture from robbing their plane. Tony sends Happy for Peter and brings him to the Avengers facility. He apoligizes for taking the suit and commends him for doing the right thing. He says he was wrong about him and offers to mentor him and join the team with a new suit and a press conference to introduce Spider-Man into the Avengers. Peter denies the offer to keep being the neigborhood spider-man thinking it was a test and Happy takes him home. At the end, Pepper comes out asking what they're going to do without Peter and Tony asks Happy if he still has the ring turning the press conference into an engagement announcement. He also sends Peter back his suit.</p>

When all seems lost, Captain Marvel arrives and rescues them. She takes the ship to the New Avengers Facility where Tony meets up with the remaining Avengers and Pepper. The Avengers are trying to locate Thanos and seek Tony's help. Full of grief, pain, and failure, Tony snaps at Steve blaming him for everything that happened then afterwards passes out. While Tony rests and recuperates, the rest of the Avengers seek out Thanos and slaughter him after finding out the stones were destroyed. Five years later in 2023 Tony is married to Pepper with their daughter Morgan living away from everyone in a cabin. When Scott Lang reappears, Steve and Nat come up with a new plan to save the world. They approach Tony for his help on their time travel mission. Tony rejects their proposal not wanting to risk his family again.

With all the infinity stones acquired, the Avengers return to the present to finish the mission. All but Nat come back after having to sacrifice herself for the Soul Stone. The remaining Avengers grieve and argue finally deciding to finish the plan in Nat's honor. Tony places the stones on the gauntlet he created, and the Hulk snaps to bring back the vanished. The snap worked, and those who disappeared were brought back. However, soon after 2014 Thanos appears to get back the stones. Tony, Steve, and Thor team up to fight him while the gauntlet is kept away. With Thanos' army arriving, the fallen Avengers begin to arrive as well through Dr. Strange's portals. As the Avengers are all lined up, the battle begins to destroy Thanos and his army. Tony fights along Pepper in her new suit, and finally reunites with Peter in a loving embrace. At one point, Thanos seizes the gauntlet and is about to win, but Tony retrieves the stones back. He manages to snap Thanos and his army to dust. The impact of the stones fatally wounds Tony. Surrounded by Peter, Rhodey, and Pepper, and reassured that his family would be okay, Tony Stark tragically dies. The war ends, and the Avengers fall to mourn their hero.
