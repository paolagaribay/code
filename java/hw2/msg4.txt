Mr. Moran,

My agent is 6 feet tall and has short dark hair. He will be wearing a red fedora hat and holding a yellow umbrella. You are meeting him in London, so I suggest you take an umbrella too.

To evade the detectives, I have encrypted the exact location of the meeting. You may decrypt the ciphertext using the following information:
- plaintext is a PNG file;
- encryption is AES in CBC mode with no padding;
- IV is 16 zero bytes;
- key is my birthdate: first byte is the year (just two digits, i.e., number between 0 and 99), second byte is the month, third byte is the day, and the remaining bytes are all zero.

Sincerely,
Professor Moriarty
