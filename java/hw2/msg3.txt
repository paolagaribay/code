Mr. Moran,

To protect the identity of my agent from those nosy detectives, I have encrypted the description of his physical appearance.
For the encryption, I used a cipher in ECB mode with the very secret key that we exchanged a long time ago. The plaintext is a BMP file.

Sincerely,
Prof. Moriarty
