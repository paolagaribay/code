Mr. Moran,

Execute theft tonight. Once you have the diamond, follow my instructions for the exchange.

To protect the secrecy of our plan, I have encrypted my instructions. You may decrypt the ciphertext using the following information:
- encryption is AES in CFB mode with no padding;
- key is 16 bytes long, all key bytes are equal to 7;
- IV is 16 zero bytes;
- use the class SecretKeySpec to set the key for the cipher (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/SecretKeySpec.html);
- use the class IvParameterSpec to set the IV for the cipher (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/IvParameterSpec.html).

Sincerely,
Prof. M
